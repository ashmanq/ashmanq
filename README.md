# Salutations to all and sundry!

I am but a humble human on a journey of discovery, with an aim to become a real ~~boy~~ developer! On my journey I'v come equiped with:
1. The growth mindset ðŸ—¡ **sword**.
1. The ðŸ›¡ **shield** of refusal... to give up!

I currently work as a Software Developer for Toolstop, trying my best to not make too much of a mess. I am knowledgeable in the following:
* JavaScript
* React - Next.js
* C#
* HTML
* CSS
* Vue
* Ruby
* Java
* PHP


Please peruse my repositories on GitHub and if you're feeling extra nosey, have a look at my portfolio website [AshQur](https://www.ashqur.co.uk). I seek work that fuels my desire to make cool things :smile:, so if you like what you see :wink: then fire me an [email](mailto:ashir@ashqur.co.uk). 

I also sometimes draw bad art which I do in the hope that, one day, I'll get gud :grin:. So if you're especially bored then please view my [2 pieces of artwork.](https://www.instagram.com/ash_manq)

I bid you adieu!
