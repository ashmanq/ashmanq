# Salutations to all and sundry!

I am but a humble human on a journey of discovery, with an aim to become a real ~~man~~ developer! On my journey I am equiped with:
* The growth mindset **sword**
* The **shield** of refusal... to give up

I have came far on my own and with the help of the CodeClan 4 month intense coding workout. I know some things....
* JavaScript
* React
* Vue
* Ruby
* Java
* PHP
* HTML
* CSS

Please peruse my repositories on GitHub and if you're feeling extra nosey, have a look at my portfolio website [AshQur](https://www.ashqur.co.uk). I seek work with recompense! Or...like a job that pays :smile: so if you like what you see :wink: then fire me an [email](mailto:ashir@ashqur.co.uk). 

I also sometimes draw bad art which I do in the hope that, one day, I'll get gud :grin:. So if you're especially bored then please view my [2 pieces of artwork.](https://www.instagram.com/ash_manq)

I bid you adieu!
